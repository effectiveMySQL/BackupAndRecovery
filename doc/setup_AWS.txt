These steps define how to setup your account on a Linux/Mac environment to use 
Amazon Web Services.

1. Register an AWS account at http://aws.amazon.com/

 *  Goto AWS site
 *  Register email address
 *  Enter Login Credentials
 *  Enter Contact Information
 *  Enter Credit Card details
 *  Identity verification by Telephone
 *  Activation of account

NOTE: You can also register for a FREE service at http://aws.amazon.com/free/. 
This provides one free Micro instance per month and some other services.

See http://effectivemysql.com/article/setting-up-amazon-web-services  for 
detailed instructions with included screenshot examples.

2. Obtain access keys

AWS uses different account details to access the various services. Following 
your account registration you should obtain the following information for later
use.

 *  Access Key ID:
 *  Secret Access Key:
 *  X.509 Certificate (cert and pk files)
 *  AWS Account ID:
 *  Canonical User ID:

3. Configure command line EC2 Tools

AWS provides a Management Console that can perform all of the operations
described here via a web based GUI interface. The following instructions are
command line based (CLI) to enable further scripting and automation.

$ mkdir -p $HOME/aws
$ cd $HOME/aws
$ mv ~/Downloads/cert-EPE36OOAUD6QZZVFJCDJTEWFAG2EPWGA.pem  .
$ mv ~/Downloads/cert-EPE36OOAUD6QZZVFJCDJTEWFAG2EPWGA.pem  .
$ curl -o ec2-api-tools.zip http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools.zip
$ unzip -q ec2-api-tools.zip 
$ mkdir -p archive
$ mv ec2-api-tools.zip archive/
$ ln -s ec2-api-tools-* ec2
$ ls -l 
$ export EC2_HOME=$HOME/aws/ec2
$ export PATH=$EC2_HOME/bin:$PATH
$ java -version
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/
$ ec2ver

You should see something similar to the following.

1.5.2.5 2012-03-01

See http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ for more 
information on the CLI tools. The documentation header will also show the 
version number which should match the output of ec2ver
